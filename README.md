## **Credit Card Fraud Detection**

**Description**:  
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. Various models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, were trained on the dataset. The project addresses the class imbalance problem using techniques like SMOTE to enhance model performance.

**Key Features**:
- Use of various classification models for fraud detection.
- Performance evaluation using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.
- Addressing the **class imbalance** issue.

## **Iris Flower Classification**

**Description**:  
This project classifies iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM. The dataset contains features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

**Key Features**:
- Achieved **100% accuracy** with all models.
- Focus on **classification** using various algorithms.
- Data preprocessing and model evaluation using **accuracy** and **confusion matrix**.

## **Movie Rating Prediction**

**Description**:  
In this project, we predict movie ratings using machine learning. The dataset contains historical movie ratings, and the models attempt to predict ratings for unseen data. Techniques like **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering** are used to generate recommendations.

**Key Features**:
- Predicting movie ratings using **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering**.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **feature engineering**.
- Evaluation metrics include **RMSE** and **MAE**.

## **Sales Prediction Using Python**

**Description**:  
This project predicts sales figures using machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and Decision Trees. It utilizes historical sales data, marketing budget, and various other features to predict future sales.

**Key Features**:
- Use of multiple regression models to predict sales.
- Performance evaluation using **MAE**, **MSE**, and **RÂ²**.
- Detailed **data preprocessing** and feature scaling.

## **Titanic Survival Prediction**

**Description**:  
This project builds a machine learning model to predict survival on the Titanic using the **Titanic dataset**. The dataset includes features like passenger class, age, sex, and embarked port. Various models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest** were used.

**Key Features**:
- Machine learning classification models to predict survival.
- **Data preprocessing** including handling missing values and feature engineering.
- Performance evaluation using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.
