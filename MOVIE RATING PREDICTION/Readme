IMDb Movie Rating Prediction with Python
Predicting IMDb movie ratings based on various movie features using machine learning models

Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict IMDb ratings for Indian movies. The dataset includes various movie attributes such as genre, director, actors, and votes. By building several models, we aim to provide insights into how these features influence movie ratings.

Feature Engineering: Convert categorical variables to numerical values, scale the features, and create new insightful features (e.g., Director's Average Rating, Actor Popularity).
2. Machine Learning Models Used:
Linear Regression:
Simple linear regression model to predict ratings based on movie features.
Random Forest Regressor:
Ensemble model utilizing multiple decision trees for robust predictions.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression:
Nonlinear model to capture complex relationships between movie features and ratings.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression:
Algorithm predicting ratings based on the average ratings of the nearest neighbors.
Decision Tree Regression:
A tree-like model splitting the data into decision nodes for prediction.
3. Feature Engineering:
Director's Average Rating:
Calculated based on ratings of movies directed by the same individual.
Actor Popularity:
Measured by how frequently an actor appears in top-rated movies.
4. Data Visualization:
Visualizing data distribution, model predictions, and relationships between various features for a clearer understanding of the data.
