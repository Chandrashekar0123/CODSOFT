## 🎨 Visualization Examples
🔹 **Pairplot of Features**
```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.pairplot(df, hue='species')
```
🔹 **Confusion Matrix Visualization**
```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d')
```
